        Eggplant Parmesan, also known as Eggplant Parmigiana, is a delightful Italian dish that satisfies both
        vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. This culinary masterpiece showcases the versatility of eggplant as it
        transforms into a crispy and tender delight. Thick slices of eggplant are breaded, fried to golden perfection,
        and then layered
        with a vibrant marinara sauce. Each layer of eggplant is generously coated with a combination of mozzarella and
        Parmesan cheese, creating a gooey and melty blanket of deliciousness. Baked to bubbly perfection, Eggplant
        Parmesan is a harmonious fusion of flavors and textures that will leave you craving for more.

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the temperature specified in the recipe.</li>
        <li>Slice the eggplant into thick rounds and season with salt. Let it sit for a few minutes to draw out excess

        <li>In separate shallow bowls, prepare one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Dredge each eggplant slice in the flour, dip it in the beaten eggs, and coat it with breadcrumbs. Repeat for
            all the slices.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Fry the breaded eggplant slices until golden on both
            sides. Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven again, if necessary, to the baking temperature specified in the recipe.</li>
        <li>In a baking dish, spread a layer of marinara sauce. Arrange a layer of fried eggplant slices on top.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the eggplant slices, followed by some torn basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering process with the remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of cheese and basil on top.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the dish is heated through.</li>
        <li>Allow it to cool for a few minutes, then serve the Eggplant Parmesan hot and enjoy!</li>
